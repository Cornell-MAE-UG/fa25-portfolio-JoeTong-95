## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/joe_image.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a mechanical engineer passionate about building complete systems that blend mechatronics, embedded electronics, and thoughtful design. I love taking ideas from concept to functioning hardware—whether that means designing PCBs, developing ESP32-based control systems, or creating mechanical assemblies that integrate seamlessly with software. My work sits at the intersection of engineering precision and creative problem-solving, and I’m driven by projects that challenge me to learn, prototype, and refine continuously.
